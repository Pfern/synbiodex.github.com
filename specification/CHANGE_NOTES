*Requested new RFC# targeted at 1.1.0*

UML diagram (Figure 5)
======================
v1.0.0 to v1.0.3
Removed "s" from "subComponents", the property is now "subComponent"
Changed datatype of "bioStart" from "int()" to "positiveInteger"
Changed datatype of "bioEnd" from "int()" to "positiveInteger"
v1.0.3 to v1.0.8
sync UML diagram versions with document

Specification document
======================
v1.0.10 to v1.0.11
- formatting/page numbers have changed
- from Mandy's comments
- p. 5 "As software tools are adapt to progress ..." changed to "As software tools are adapted to progress ..."
- p. 6 "For example, DNA components can be hypothesized to have a biological function, deemed necessary for DNA assembly processes, or serve the synthetic biologist as landmarks in analysis."  Verbs should be consistent...
now reads:
"For example, DNA components can be hypothesized to have a biological function, be deemed necessary for DNA assembly processes, or have served as landmarks in analysis."
- p 9 (Top) "SBOL version 1.0, focuses on the representation of DNA components as the SBOL:Core:model." (Shouldn't this be SBOL version 1.0.0 or 1.1.0?) corrected to 1.1.0

- Mnady: "SBOL:Vocabulary defines the key terms used in the core model." Didn't we get rid of the SBOL Vocabulary?  I guess you talk later about some of the terminology (ie, DnaComponent) being part of the SBOL:Vocabulary, but I wonder if that will be confusing since there is also going to be an SBOL:Vocabulary extension (which you also refer to in this document.)  You also have a section in this document called SBOL Vocabulary (8.3) -- I'm just wondering if we are overusing this.
You identify a couple of provisional terms that we are going to ask the Sequence Ontology folks to add (Gene Expression and DNA Construction, and you refer the reader to a list of provisional terms in the Appendix.  The list in the appendix would appear to be examples of actual Sequence Ontology terms, not provisional ones (the two you name on page 9 are not in there, for example.)
Mike: removed the references to extensions, but I kept "SBOL:Vocabulary" which are terms specific to SBOL, with no overlap with SO. 
Section 8.3 is the vocabulary used to define Core classes.
Section 8.1 now reads:
SBOL Vocabulary
In version 1.1.0, SBOL:Vocabulary defines the core concepts used by SBOL in the structured description of synthetic DNA designs. SBOL:Core terms are DnaComponent, DnaSequence, and SequenceAnnotation. To provide user-defined groupings of DnaComponents, SBOL:Core also defines a Collection. Additional terms, such as those used as used to classify DNA Components by type (see section 8.5.1) are defined by the Sequence Ontology (Eilbeck 2005, Mungall 2010). New terminology should be added in collaboration with the Sequence Ontology project.
"
Section 8.3 now reads: 
"The SBOL:Vocabulary defines terms used in SBOL. Below we define terms for the Core. Non-SBOL term definitions such as those needed to classify DnaComponents by type can be obtained from the Sequence Ontology (Eilbeck 2005, Mungall 2010). For example, a promoter region, coding sequence, and transcriptional terminator are all defined by the Sequence Ontology (see the Appendix for a list of examples). Terminology outside of the scope of the Sequence Ontology should be submitted as new term requests to its curators (http://www.sequenceontology.org/)."

p 9 "start with lower cases letters and follow lower camelCase."  Probably it is sufficient to say "lower camelCase", because by definition a lower camelCase term starts with a lower-case letter, but if you want to include the additional clarification, it should be "start with lower-case letters". - done

p.20 SequenceAnnotation.strand elements are missing colons, ie "strand +" instead of "strand: +" This is inconsistent w/p.19 -done

p.23 Cesar's email address is no longer valid -- should use cesarr@me.com, unless there is another email address he would prefer to have used. -done


v1.0.9 to v1.0.10
pg 10 Clarrified Version policy
"Major versions (X) ... the submission of the specification document.. (BBF RFC)" added "is REQUIRED".
"Minor versions (Y)" added "The submission of the specification document to ... (BBF RFC) is OPTIONAL." 
"Patch versions (Z)" added "The submission of the specification document to the BioBrick Foundation as a Request For Comment (BBF RFC) is NOT RECOMMENDED."
Changed any mentions of v1.0.0 which needed to be updated to v1.1.0
pg 1 changed RFC# from 84 to 87; 87 replaces 84
pg 15 added table of nucleotide ambiguity codes to defintion of DnaSequence.

p. 5 "As software tools are adapt to progress ..." should be "As software tools are adapted to progress ..." -done
p. 6 "For example, DNA components can be hypothesized to have a biological function, deemed necessary for DNA assembly processes, or serve the synthetic biologist as landmarks in analysis."  Verbs should be consistent.
changed to ", or have served as landmarks in analysis."-done, check w/ Mandy

p 9 (Top) "SBOL version 1.0, focuses on the representation of DNA components as the SBOL:Core:model." (Shouldn't this be SBOL version 1.0.0 or 1.1.0?) -done



v1.0.8 to v1.0.9
Fixed appendix: SO URI's to use "purl" namespace
Fixed appendix: removed non-SO examples
Fixed appendix: removed sub-sections - Appendix is now just "examples" of SO
Fixed page breaks
Fixed other formatting
