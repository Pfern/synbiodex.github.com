v1.0.0 to v1.0.3
Removed "s" from "subComponents", the property is now "subComponent"

v1.0.3 to v1.0.8 - todo
sync UML diagram versions with document

Specification document - todo

pg 11 Figure 5 updated to v1.0.2 "subComponents" changed to "subComponent".
pg 11 Figure 5 updated to v1.0.8 change bioStart and bioEnd datatype "int()" to "positiveInteger()"
pg 11 Firgure 5 add current version # (v1.1.0) to diagram, keep the spec synced w/ UML diagram. 
pg 13 remove "for" in DC.name last sent. "and meaniglful, for as may be done" to "and meaningful, as may be done"

pg 16 remove wording in SA.precedes "Finally, a null value for a precedes property indicates the terminal SequenceAnnotation within a given DnaComponent. Absence of the precedes relation indicates this knowledge is not known."

pg 16 change "... sa1.bioEnd is strictly less than sa2.bioStart" to "...sa1.bioEnd is strictly greater than sa2.bioStart"
pg 19 Figure 7.b add "strand: +" to SequenceAnnotations
pg 20 change "subcomposition" to "composition"
