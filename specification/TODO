1.0.9 to 1.1.0
Proposed by Mike
The strand issue
pg 15,16 main section with language re: SA.strand
- The specification uses the word "direction" throughout when discussing strand of the subComponent(DC). Possibly better language would use the word orientation.
- The [+/-] should be replaced with [+/-/.] (in def SA and UML fig 5)
SA 
currently says:
The direction of the subComponent is specified by the strand [+/-]. Sequences used are assumed, by convention, to be specified 5' to 3', therefore the + strand is 5' to 3' and the - strand is 3' to 5'."
change this

- The definition of SA.subComponent refers to "subsequence" 
if the rc(dc.seq.ds.nuc) is approved
This will ne to be clarified for each 3 of the strand cases.
SA+.subComponent.dc.seq.ds.nuc will be subsequence
SA-.subCmponent.dc.seq.ds.nuc will be rc(subsequence)
SA..subComponent.dc.seq.ds.nuc will be subsequence

SA.strand
Currently says:
"Strand orientation + or - of the subComponent relative to the DNA sequence of the DnaComponent being annotated. DnaSequence is by convention assumed 5' to 3', therefore the "+" strand is 5' to 3' and the "-" strand is 3' to 5'."

change this

Add an example or change one of the current ones to one with a - strand.
