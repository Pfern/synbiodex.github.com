v1.1.0

**section 8.5.2 DnaSequence**
MOVE - "the DNA sequence MUST BE lower-case" to the a/b/c list of restrictions? That way this restriction would not be lost in the text:
b becomes c, c becomes d
new b. as: "b. the DNA sequence MUST use exclusively lowercase characters"

**disjointness of SBOL core types**
ADD "not legal for the same instance to implement more than one SBOL core Class"For example, it would not be legal for something to be both a DNAComponend and a SequenceAnnotation.
